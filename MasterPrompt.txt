PRD:
## 1. Overview

**Habibi Stream** is an **Arabic-first** live-streaming platform for the **MENA region** focused on **family-friendly, halal** content. The initial release supports **streaming only** (no VOD/clips). Users can watch live streams, interact via chat and reactions, and financially support creators through subscriptions, tips, and virtual gifts using a platform currency. The product launches as a **closed beta** across **mobile (React Native)** and **web**.

## 2. Problem Statement

Arabic-speaking audiences in MENA lack a mainstream live-streaming platform that is:

* **Culturally aligned** with **halal, family-friendly** expectations, and
* **Designed primarily for Arabic** discovery, community interaction, and creator growth.

Existing platforms are either not tailored for Arabic-first experiences, or they include/enable content and community norms that conflict with the desired family-friendly/halal positioning.

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

1. Enable users in MENA to **discover and watch halal, family-friendly live streams in Arabic**.
2. Enable creators to **go live from a phone camera** with essential **chat moderation tools**.
3. Provide core community mechanics: **follow, live chat, reactions**, and **basic discovery**.
4. Enable creator monetization through:

   * **Subscriptions**
   * **Tips (donations)**
   * **Virtual gifts** using **platform currency**
5. Launch a **closed beta** with measurable retention, content supply, and safety outcomes.

### Non-Goals (v1)

1. No **VOD**, **clips**, or post-stream replay.
2. No **music category** or music-focused streaming features.
3. No copyright/DMCA-style workflows at launch.
4. No advanced creator tooling (overlays marketplace, studios, multi-camera, etc.) unless explicitly required later.
5. No final/locked creator revenue share policy in v1 (TBD).

## 4. User Personas and Core Use Cases

### Personas

1. **Viewer (Family-Friendly Audience)**

   * Arabic-speaking, wants safe entertainment/education.
   * Values clear content standards and easy discovery.
2. **Creator (Halal Content Streamer)**

   * Streams halal content (e.g., gaming, talk, education, hobbies).
   * Needs simple mobile streaming + tools to keep chat clean.
3. **Moderator (Platform or Community Moderator)**

   * Helps enforce halal/family-friendly rules in chat and streams.
   * Needs reporting and enforcement tools (scope TBD).

### Core Use Cases

1. Viewer browses recommendations and starts watching a live stream.
2. Viewer participates via **live chat** and **reactions**.
3. Viewer **follows** a creator and receives relevant surfacing of live streams (mechanism TBD).
4. Viewer supports a creator via **subscription**, **tip**, or **virtual gift**.

Platform Screens:
# A) Mobile App Screens

## A1) Viewer & General (MVP)

1. **Splash / Loading**
2. **Welcome** (Login entry point)
3. **Login (Email)**
4. **Sign Up (Email)**
5. **Email Verification / Confirm Email** *(if you require verification)*
6. **Create Profile** (display name, avatar optional)
7. **Home – For You (Live Feed / Recommendations)**
8. **Following (Live Feed from followed creators)**
9. **Search** (search field + results)
10. **Category Browse** (halal categories list)
11. **Category Results** (streams in selected category)
12. **Live Player** (video + stream info)
13. **Live Chat (within Live Player)** *(can be a tab/panel, still a “screen state”)*
14. **Gift / Tip Send** (gift picker + amount confirm)
15. **Purchase Currency / Wallet Top-up**
16. **Transaction Success / Receipt** (confirmation after purchase or gift/tip)
17. **Creator Profile** (view creator, follow, subscribe)
18. **My Profile** (your profile)
19. **Settings**
20. **Report** (report stream or message + reason select)
21. **Blocked Users** (manage blocks)
22. **Notifications** *(optional for MVP; recommended if you plan any alerts)*

**MVP mobile viewer subtotal:** **21–22 screens** (depending on email verification + notifications)

---

## A2) Creator (MVP)

23. **Go Live – Setup** (title, category, basic settings)
24. **Go Live – Camera Preview** (before starting)
25. **Live Host Room** (while live: viewer count, chat, end stream)
26. **Chat Moderation Actions** (timeout/ban/delete) *(can be a bottom sheet modal, but still designable UI)*

**MVP mobile creator subtotal:** **4 screens**

✅ **Total Mobile MVP:** **25–26 screens**

---

## A3) Admin/Operations (Mobile)

For closed beta, admins usually use web. If you *must* include admin on mobile:

* **Admin Report Queue**
* **Admin User Detail**
* **Admin Stream Actions**

I recommend **web-only** for admin in beta.

---

# B) Web Screens

Web should mirror viewer features + basic creator start (if creators can stream from web later). Since your v1 creator streaming is from **phone camera**, web can be **viewer-first** in beta.

1. **Landing / Home (For You Live Feed)**
2. **Login**
3. **Sign Up**
4. **Create Profile**
5. **Following**

12. **Wallet / Buy Currency**
13. **Gift/Tip Modal** (overlay on Live page)
14. **Subscription Purchase Modal/Page**
15. **Settings**
16. **Report Modal/Page**
17. **Blocked Users**

✅ **Total Web MVP:** **17 screens/pages** (counting modals as designable states)

---

## B2) Admin Console (Recommended for Beta)

This is important because you said moderation approach isn’t defined yet—but you *will* need basic enforcement in beta.

18. **Admin Login**
19. **Admin Dashboard**
20. **Reports Queue**
21. **Report Detail** (stream/message context + action)
22. **User Detail** (suspend/unsuspend)
23. **Stream Detail** (disable stream)
24. **Verified Creator Management** *(optional)*

✅ **Admin Web:** **6–7 pages**

✅ **Total Web MVP (including Admin):** **23–24 pages**

---

# C) Recommended “Still MVP” Enhancements (avoid gaps)

## Why this structure works (quick rationale)

* **apps/** = “things users run” (mobile, web, admin, api)
* **services/** = backend sidecars that scale independently (workers, media)
* **packages/** = shared code (UI primitives, types, utils, SDK)
* **infra/** = deployment and local environment scaffolding
* Keeps **domain types/contracts centralized** to prevent drift between mobile/web/backend
* Keeps **admin isolated** so it doesn’t pollute user-facing web logic

---

## Feature module pattern (recommended for your screens)

Inside `apps/mobile/src/features/` and `apps/web/src/features/`:

```
features/
├─ auth/
├─ live/
├─ chat/
├─ discovery/
├─ wallet/
├─ gifting/
├─ subscriptions/
├─ profile/
└─ reports/
```

Each feature can contain:

* `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `state/`, `types.ts`, `selectors.ts`
  This keeps the codebase aligned with product areas (streams/chat/wallet).

---

## Backend module pattern (aligned with PRD)

Inside `apps/api/src/modules/`:

```
modules/
├─ auth/
├─ users/
├─ streams/
├─ chat/
├─ discovery/
├─ wallet/
├─ gifting/
├─ subscriptions/
├─ reports/
├─ moderation/
└─ admin/
```

technologies:
Here is the comprehensive architectural blueprint and phased plan for building a top-tier live streaming application.

## The "Best of the Best" Technology Stack

### 1. Mobile Frontend: React Native -> web React

For the mobile client, React Native is an exceptionally strong choice. It allows for rapid feature iteration across both iOS and Android from a single codebase. Crucially, it provides the capability to drop down into native code via bridging when absolute maximum performance is needed, allowing you to easily integrate highly optimized, low-level native video player SDKs directly into the app.

### 2. Backend Application Layer: Node.js

Live streaming apps require a backend that can handle thousands of concurrent, I/O-heavy requests, especially for real-time events. Node.js is the perfect engine here. Its event-driven, non-blocking architecture is tailor-made for managing high volumes of concurrent WebSocket connections, which you will absolutely need for the chat and live notification systems.

### 3. Database & Caching Strategy

A robust, hybrid data layer is critical to prevent bottlenecks under sudden heavy loads:

* **Primary Relational Database (PostgreSQL):** Battle-tested, highly reliable, and perfect for managing complex structured data like user profiles, channel subscriptions, follower graphs, and financial transactions.
* **In-Memory Cache (Redis):** Essential for pub/sub messaging (routing real-time chat messages to the right stream rooms) and caching highly requested volatile data, like live viewer counts and active stream lists.
* **Chat Log Storage (NoSQL):** A document database like MongoDB or Amazon DynamoDB to handle the massive, unstructured, high-velocity write volume of live chat logs without locking up your primary PostgreSQL database.

### 4. Streaming Infrastructure: Amazon IVS (Interactive Video Service)

Do not build your own video ingestion and transcoding pipeline from scratch using raw servers and FFmpeg unless you want an endless maintenance nightmare. To get "the best," you must use a managed service.

* **The Solution:** Amazon IVS is literally the underlying technology that powers Twitch, packaged as an AWS service. It provides broadcast-grade RTMP ingestion, handles all adaptive bitrate transcoding on the fly, and distributes the video globally via a custom CDN for massive scale. It offers broadcast latency (under 3 seconds) or real-time latency (under 300ms using WebRTC primitives).
